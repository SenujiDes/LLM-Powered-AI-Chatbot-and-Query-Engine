Canada was expected to announce\nsimilar investments in its 2023 budget in order to remain\ncompetitive with its southern neighbour.[6]\nOn 22 June 2023 , all parts of the budget received Royal assent ,\nand became law.[7]\nThe budget included $43B in net new spending over six years,[8]\nincluding $20B for a new 15 per cent refundable tax credit to\npromote investment in green technologies.[9] $13B was also\nallocated to implement a means-tested dental care program, a\npolicy originating in the NDP-Libera l deal of 2022.[8] The Canadian Dental Care Plan  began rollout in\nDecember 2023.[10]\nThe budget introduced a \"grocery rebate\" of up to $467 for eligible families and up to $234 for eligible\nsingle people with no kids. The Canada Student Grants  also saw a 40% increase in funding.[11]\nFreeland issued $15B of spending  cuts, achieved by defunding public services and cancelling\npreviously announced programs.[12] A new tax 2% on stock buybacks  was also introduced.[11]Background\nMeasures\nHousing6/19/24, 1:59 PM 2023 Canadian federal budget - Wikipedia\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Canadian_federal_budget 1/4", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "Document"}, "__type__": "4"}, "494ea8ae-d28f-4d92-9502-3eaf964e9953": {"__data__": {"id_": "494ea8ae-d28f-4d92-9502-3eaf964e9953", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "2", "file_name": "2023_canadian_budget.pdf", "file_path": "/Users/senujidesilva/Downloads/Generative AI/chatbot2/mydata/2023_canadian_budget.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 376126, "creation_date": "2024-08-24", "last_modified_date": "2024-08-24"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {}, "text": "The budg et created the government's First Home Savings Account (FHSA), offering tax savings for\nfirst-time buyers, and budgeted roughly $925 million in 2023\u20132024 for the \"housing accelerator\nfund,\" an incentive announced in Budget 2022 to encourage municipalities to make home\nconstruction easier.[13]\nThe budget relaxed Canada's strict rules on foreign home buying, and have given more foreign stake in\ndeveloping comme rcial real estate.

This is a partial reversal of the proposed two-year ban on\nhome buying by non-Canadians for increasing housing affordability and decreasing inflation. The ban\nwas supposed to start by January 1, 2023 and be on effect till 2025.[14]\nConservative party  lead er Pierre Poilievre  strongly criticized the budget, arguing it included too much\nnew spending and that such policy would result in higher inflation. The leader of the Official\nOpposition  also stated that the housing measures announced in the budget were insufficient to solve\nthe housing crisis.[11] Poilievre also stated that the party would not vote for the budget.\nNDP  leader Jagmeet Singh  praised the budget as the \"biggest expansion of our health care in a\ngeneration\", and stated NDP MPs would vote in its favour.[11]\nOn the contrary, both Bloc Qu\u00e9b \u00e9cois  leader Yves-Fran\u00e7ois Blan chet  and Green Party leader Elizabeth\nMay  believed the budget did not increase health care spending enough.
